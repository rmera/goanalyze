goAnalize!

Or, well, dont. But really, do.


goAnalize provides molecular modelling functionality to PyMOL.
From optimizing a structure to analyzing a trajectory.
See the documentarion.

The whole goAnalize is open source. The Go parts are LGPL, the python parts
are under a more liberal license (see the source files for details, the LGPL
license is included in the repo, see the file "LICENSE"). 
This way of licensing is valid, as none of them is compiled.
against the other. I might change the current licensing if I see need.

or any program based on goChem before such a publication is available,
we ask you to support goChem by citing the library in your publication as:

chemistry". https://www.github.com/rmera/gochem
